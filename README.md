# face_emotion_recognition
<b>Overview</b>
<br>
This project aims to implement a facial emotion detection system using transfer learning techniques. The model is built on TensorFlow and utilizes OpenCV, CV2, MobileNetV2, and NumPy. The training is performed on the FER 2013 Google Dataset, a widely used dataset for facial emotion recognition.
<br>

<b>Features</b>
<br>
Transfer learning with MobileNetV2: Leverage the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model as a feature extractor for improved accuracy and faster convergence.
Real-time emotion detection: Utilize OpenCV and CV2 for capturing real-time video frames and processing them to identify facial emotions.
FER 2013 Google Dataset: Train the model on a diverse dataset containing facial images annotated with seven different emotions - anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.
